# Ripping the Visual Studio Editor Apart with Projection Buffers

## Objective
1. Introduction to Projection Buffers

## How this project is built.
1. See the article in the refernces.

## Build and Run.
1. This is currently not working. The next example(900995-EditorWithToolBox) is also exactly same, only a few changes like try catch block that added around suspecious code. The next example is ment as a step by step guide. 

3. I try to break it down to just deal with the tool box, so created another example `901010-ToolboxTrailOne` but even that is having problem
