# Trails With ToolBox

## Objective
1. To understand Smart Tags. But smart tags are depricated. So in this example, smart tags are not used but instead, error tags are used. This example introduces `ITextStructureNavigatorSelectorService` and `ITextStructureNavigator`. This example also introduces `IViewTaggerProvider`

## How this project is built.

2. Add new item EditorClassifier. This adds many references and also makes this an MEF component. Now just delete the set of files added in this step.
