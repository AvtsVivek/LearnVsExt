Today I want to start another series of articles, which will discuss extensions for the text editor in Visual Studio.
You may ask, “What does JSON have to do with it?”
The thing is that we will not be developing some abstract “editor extensions”, but rather we will be improving the existing editor for JSON. Yes, many of the techniques that we will be considering can be applied to absolutely any language editor supported in Visual Studio, but some (for example, extensions for the Code Insight mechanism – code hints) will be completely JSON-specific.

For those who attended our first Open Tech Talk at EPAM Izhevsk, I will immediately say that this series will be based on the materials of that report of mine. So those who were there and remember everything – do not need to read further.
