## Notes
1. Adds completion items to all C# completion sessions. Added items are "Hello", "World" and either "even" or "odd", depending on whether the line is at an even or odd numbered offset.

2. Not sure what this even or odd means.

3. The project is built as AsyncQuickInfoSourceIntro. 

4. Make this an MEF component.
